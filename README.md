# iRat-Tools
iRat-Tools allows you to keep an eye on your IT infrastructure.

Written in HTML / CSS / JavaScript / PHP / MySQL, it allows to:
- Monitor your hardware
- Monitor network
- Save your license and your passwords
- Save your hardware inventory
- Turn on or off remote computers
- Manage your web server

Everything works with modules that you can download on our website (available soon).

It is available in several languages ... 

When I have time, I will complete the description and create a wiki page to help users to install, update and use our tool.
